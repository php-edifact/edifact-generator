The classes provided by this package give a fluent interface
which simplifies the encoding of an EDI (mainly UN/EDIFACT) message.

The resulting array can be encoded in a valid message with EDI\Encoder class provided
by [https://github.com/PHPEdifact/edifact](https://github.com/PHPEdifact/edifact).

Each message type extends a generic Message class which provides common helpers.

See [SAMPLES.md](SAMPLES.md) for code examples using this library.
